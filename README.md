Based on [T-UI Linux CLI Launcher](https://github.com/fAndreuzzi/TUI-ConsoleLauncher).
The idea is to continue using a text based launcher in a very minimalist form for people like me who use their phone an awful lot.

Working on this separately as:

1. I'm redesigning the interaction with the launcher completely making this a very minimal less-text-no-icons based launcher.
2. It is designed keeping people who use their phone an awful lot.
2. The author of T-UI doesn't accept pull requests as mentioned in his readme.

This is a work in progress and hopefully if things come out the way I want them to, I'll have a published version of the app in April 2019.
